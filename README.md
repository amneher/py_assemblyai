# A little Python3 application. Just a toy to use AssemblyAI's API.
- You'll need to sign up for an AssemblyAI account and plug in your API key,
then it should just work for most any audio file on your system. 

## To Do
- Allow for non-local audio files.
- Allow for file or direct output.
- I'll build a GUI later, likely using JS and Electron.
